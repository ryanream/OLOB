                Welcome to aolob! here's the scoop

                <p>We're going throw back this year. Not too far though... 
                As much as you weirdos love reefer, Hammertime and boomboxes, 
                we're letting all of that go. Well, not those things specifically, 
                but you get the idea. We're going back to a time John Candy would 
                call "the future..." Nerds decided they wanted to rule the world, enter...</p>

                <p>In honor of the .coms, chatrooms and Nelly. Please
                put on your thinking cap and remember back as far as you can.
                Allll the way back to.... YOUR FIRST EMAIL ADDRESS!</p>
                
                <p>Alex already spilled the beans and said his first choice 
                'sexybeast69@aol.com' was taken before he could secure it back 
                in '01. Good thing too, it would have been on the back of his 
                jersey this year at OLOB.</p>
                
                <p>That's right, your first email address ever will be on display
                as close to it's creator as we can get. (our tiny little 2000s
                brains are still rattling around in the back of our heads somewhere, 
                right? That's what I assumed anyway.) </p>
                
                <p>Hopefully you've lived up to your projection of yourself. 
                Hopefully it's PG-13.</p>
